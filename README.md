##  The Problem - Shoulder Surfing

You're in a crowded place ‚Äî typing an OTP, a note, or a juicy message or anything in your app's text interface  ‚Äî  
and suddenly someone shoulder surfs or sneaks and you're like *Paathutaan daa!*  

People around you are reading over your shoulder.

## Inspired by
Vadivelu, Shoulder surfers, And a sprinkle of common sense.

## License: MIT 
Feel free to confuse freely.

## Real-world Use Cases
-  Building an interface for these and beyond,
-  Entering passwords or OTPs in public,
-  Writing private notes,
-  Simply confusing nosy co-passengers,co-workers etc..
-  just for fun!

##  The Solution

**SoonaPaanaSecurityKit** is a simple, lightweight Swift package that lets you:

-  **Obfuscate** typed text in real-time (like `yt$%78&`)
-  **Reveal on long-press** ‚Äî temporary, like a whisper
-  Works with both `UITextField` and `UITextView`
-  **No autocorrect or spellcheck** interference
-  Easily revert obfuscated text using a confuser logic
## Demo: 
https://github.com/vigneshios/SoonaPaanaLibraryDemoApp/tree/master

| Component             | Purpose                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `SoonaPaanaTextField` | For single-line secret input          |
| `SoonaPaanaTextView`  | For multi-line disguised typing       |
| `SoonaPaanaConfuser`  | Obfuscates and restores original text |
